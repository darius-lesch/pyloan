## Project Overview
This is a Python package intended for defining and analyzing mortgage and/or loand payment schedules, including periodic and ad-hoc repayments. The objective is to have a lean and robust mortage and/or loan payment schedule comparison tool that would allow users to make informed decisions about mortgages and/or loans.

## Technology Stack
* **Code:** all code is writeen in Python.
* **User Interface:** this is a command line tool, but the project objective would be to introduce an html user interface.

## Common Tasks:
* **Feature Development:** Create python-based methods enhance `pyloan` package features.
* **Bug Fixes:** Address issues in the code. Make sure that the best practices for building Python package are used consistently.
* **Refactoring**: Improve existing code for readability and performance. But avoid introducing breaking changes without a clear plan.

## Important Notes:
* When working on new features, create a separate branch from the `develop` branch ad submit a pull request for review. Follow the `gitflow` model.
