Everything you need to know to get started with PyLoan - a mortgage/loan calculation tool.

Define a loan
=============
Defining a loan with PyLoan is very simple. Begin by importing the PyLoan module::

 from pyloan import pyloan

Next define a loan::

  loan = pyloan.Loan(loan_amount=160000,interest_rate=1.1,loan_term=10,start_date='2020-06-15')

The above defines a 10-year mortgage/loan of 160,000 EUR with annual interest of 1.1% starting on the 15th of June 2020. By default, monthly payment amount will be calculated to amortize the loan amount fully over the given loan term. Also, by default, monthly payments fall on the last day of the month.

Loan arguments
--------------
The loan has the following **required arguments**:

* ``loan_amount``: the amount of money being borrowed. Input must be greater than zero.
* ``interest_rate``: the annual interest paid on the loan/mortgage. Input must be greater than zero.
* ``loan_term``: the number of years of the loan/mortgage. Input must be an integer greater or equal than 1-year.
* ``start_date``: the date as of which the loan/mortgage begins. Input format must be YYYY-MM-DD.

In addition, the loan has the following **optional argument**:

* ``payment_amount``: the amount used to repay loan/interest. Default value is None. When the value is set to other than None, the specified amount will be used to cover interest and principal repayments.
* ``first_payment_date``: the date as at which first payment on the loan/mortget is made. Input format must be YYYY-MM-DD and greater than the start date. Default value is None.
* ``payment_end_of_month``: boolean argument that defines whether loan/mortgage repayments fall on month-end or not. Default value is True. If set to False, and ``first_payment_date`` is None then loan/mortgage payments will fall on the day specified in the ``start_date``.
* ``annual_payments``: the number of annual payments on the loan/mortgage. The argument can be set to either 12 (monthly), 4 (quarterly), 2 (semi-annual), and 1 (annual). The default value is 12 (monthly).
* ``interest_only_period``: the number of interest-only payments on the loan/mortgage. The default value is 0.
* ``compounding_method``: the compounding method used to accrue interest on the loan/mortgage. The default value is '30E/360', otherwise known 30/360 German (or 30E/360 ISDA). For more details on other alternatives, see :ref:`Section on interest rate compounding`.
* ``loan_type``: type of laon/mortgage. Default value is annuity. Alternative values are: linear and interest-only. 

Get payment schedule
====================
To view the payment schedule and loan amortization use the ``get_payment_schedule`` method::

  payment_schedule = loan.get_payment_schedule()

The above outputs a list of named tuples with the following fields per row:

* ``date``: date of payment.
* ``payment_amount``: periodic payment amount of principal and interest.
* ``interest_amount``: part of periodic payment amount that is interest.
* ``principal_amount``: part of periodic payment amount that is principal.
* ``special_principal_amount``: part of periodic payment amount that is ad-hoc/special principal.
* ``total_principal_amount``: sum of `principal_amount` and `special_principal_amount` (if applicable).
* ``loan_balance_amount``: amount of loan balance as at end of payment `date`.

The first row represents the loan start with the 'loan_balance_column' equal to the loan amount. Each subsequent row represents loan repayment.

.. tip::
   To define payment schedule as `pandas` DataFrame, use the method `from_records`::

    df=pd.DataFrame.from_records(loan.get_payment_schedule(),columns=pyloan.Payment._fields)

   This will generate a familiar DataFrame with named tuple fields as columns.

.. _Section on payment amount:

Specify payment amount
======================
The example above calculated the payment amount that fully amortized the loan amount over its term. It is possible to specify a payment amount. Depending on the payment amount, the loan may be fully amortized over the loan term of not. To specify the payment amount use ``Loan`` argument ``payment_amount``. Using the example above, add payment amount of 888.33 EUR per month::

  loan = pyloan.Loan(loan_amount=160000,interest_rate=1.1,loan_term=10,start_date='2020-06-15',payment_amount=888.33)

.. image:: _static/specify_payment_amount.png
   :alt: Pandas DataFrame output of the payment schedule with the specified payment amount.

Specify payment frequency
=========================
The example above defines a loan with monthly repayment basis. It is possible to change this to quarterly, semi-annual or annual payments by setting value of the ``Loan`` argument ``annual_payments`` to 4, 2 or 1, respectively. Default argument value is 12 (monthly payments).

In addition, the payment schedule above assumes that payments are made at month end, with the first payment starting on the 30th of June 2020. In case repayments are not made at month end, this can be adjusted by setting the ``Loan`` argument ``payment_end_of_month`` to ``False`` and setting the argument ``first_payment_date`` to the date of the first payment date.

Below is an example of the same loan that is paid on quarterly basis, on the 15th of every month::

 loan = pyloan.Loan(loan_amount=160000,interest_rate=1.1,loan_term=10,start_date='2020-06-15',payment_amount=888.33,annual_payments=4)

.. image:: _static/loan_quarterly_payments.png
   :alt: Pandas DataFrame output of the payment schedule on quarterly basis.

Specify payment date
====================
In the examples above, payments were made on month end. It is possible to change this to a particular day of the month by setting of the ``Loan`` argument ``first_payment_date`` to a particular date. This will make the first and all subsequent payments fall on the specified day of the ``first_payment_date`` argument.

Following the example above, make first payment fall on the 17th of September. Each subsequent payment will fall on the 17th day of the month on which the payment is due.

.. image:: _static/first_payment_date.png
   :alt: Specify payment date other than month end date.

.. note::
   When attribute ``first_payment_date`` is set, then attribute  ``payment_end_of_month`` will be ignored.

Add special payments
====================
To add special payments to the loan, use the ``add_special_payment`` method. For instance, following the example above, add special payment of 5000 EUR first paid on 2021-03-15 for next 8 years paid annually::

  loan.add_special_payment(payment_amount=5000,first_payment_date='2021-03-17',special_payment_term=8,annual_payments=1)

Next, recalculate payment schedule considering special payments as defined above::

  payment_schedule = loan.get_payment_schedule()

This updates payment schedule by considering special payments

.. image:: _static/special_payments.png
   :alt: Considering special payments in payment schedule.

In the example above, special payments coincided with the payment date of a regular payment. It is possible to make special payments fall on dates other than the regular payment dates.

.. image:: _static/special_payments_on_odd_dates.png
   :alt: Special payments fall on dates other than regular payments.

Interest-only period
====================
In the examples above, principal and interest payments were made starting with the first payment due. It is possible to specify interest-only period by setting of the ``Loan`` argument ``interest_only_period`` to value greater than 0 (default value).

Using the initial example presented in this documentation, defines a 10-year mortgage/loan of 160,000 EUR with annual interest of 1.1% starting on the 15th of June 2020. By default, monthly payment amount will be calculated to amortize the loan amount fully over the given loan term. Also, by default, monthly payments fall on the last day of the month. However, let's say interest-only period is 3-months; that is the ``Loan`` argument ``interest_only_period=3``::

  loan = pyloan.Loan(loan_amount=160000,interest_rate=1.1,loan_term=10,start_date='2020-06-15',interest_only_period=3)

The loan defined above resembles the original example presented in this documentation. The only difference is that for the first 3 payments, payment includes interest-only (no principal amount).

.. image:: _static/interest_only_period.png
   :alt: Loan with 3-month interest-only period.

.. note::
  Consider that the ``Loan`` argument ``interest_only_period`` defines the number of payments that are interest-only. In the example above, payments were on monthly basis (the ``Loan`` argument ``annual_payments=12`` (default value)). If the ``Loan`` argument ``annual_payments`` is set to 6, 4 or 1 (semi-annual, quarterly or annual), then the the ``Loan`` argument ``interest_only_period=3`` would result in interest-only payments of 3 semi-annual or 3 quarterly, or 3 annual payments (depending on the ``Loan`` argument value of ``annual_payments``).

Get loan summary
================
To get loan summary, use the ``get_loan_summary`` method::

  payment_schedule = loan.get_loan_summary()

The above outputs a list of named tuples with the following fields per row:

* ``loan_amount``: original loan amount.
* ``total_payment_amount``: total amount paid (principal and interest) over the loan term.
* ``total_principal_amount``: total principal amount repaid.
* ``total_interest_amount``: total interest amount repaid.
* ``residual_loan_balance``: residual loan amount balance (which is calculated as ``loan_amount`` less ``total_principal_amount``).
* ``repayment_to_principal``: ratio of total repaid amount to total repaid principal amount (which is calculated as ``total_payment_amount`` to ``total_principal_amount``).


.. tip::
   To define payment schedule as `pandas` DataFrame, use the method `from_records`::

    loan_summary_df=pd.DataFrame.from_records([loan.get_loan_summary()],columns=pyloan.Loan_Summary._fields)

   This will generate a familiar DataFrame with named tuple fields as columns.

   .. image:: _static/loan_summary.png
      :alt: Pandas DataFrame output of the loan summary

.. _Section on interest rate compounding:

Interest rate compounding
=========================
By default PyLoan is compounding interest rates based on the 30/360 day count method, specifically the so-called 30E/360 method. To change the method use the ``compounding_method`` attribute when defining a loan, which accepts the following day count conventions:

* 30A/360.
* 30U/360.
* 30E/360.
* 30E/360 ISDA.
* A/360 (short for Actual/360).
* A/365F (short for Actual/365 Fixed).
* A/A ISDA (short for Actual/Actual ISDA).
* A/A AFB (short for Actual/Actual AFB, also known as Actual/Actual Euro).

.. tip::
   Certain day count conventions are more advantageous to the borrower while other day count conventions are more advantageous to the lender. Use the method ``get_loan_summary`` to compare which day count method is the least expensive and which is the most expensive in terms of total interest amount paid over the lifetime of a mortgage/loan.

   Following the examples above, the code block below compares total interest amount paid on a 10-year mortgage/loan of 160,000 EUR with annual interest of 1.1% starting on the 15th of June 2020::

    day_count_conventions=['30A/360','30U/360','30E/360','30E/360 ISDA','A/360','A/365F','A/A ISDA','A/A AFB']
    loan_summary=list(map(lambda x:[x,pyloan.Loan(loan_amount=160000,interest_rate=1.1,loan_term=10,start_date='2020-06-15',compounding_method=x).get_loan_summary().total_interest_amount],day_count_conventions))

   Results can be summarized in the familiar pandas DataFrame::

    loan_summary_df=pd.DataFrame(loan_summary,columns=['day_count_method','total_interest_amount'])
    loan_summary_df.sort_values(by=['total_interest_amount'],ascending=False)

   .. image:: _static/day_count_methods.png
      :alt: Pandas DataFrame comparing day count methods in terms of total interest amount paid

Loan/mortgage type
==================
Use the ``Loan`` argument ``loan_type`` to change the type of the loan/mortgage:

* 'annuity' (default): gross monthly costs - principal plus interest - remain fixed during the term of the loan/mortgage.
* 'linear': net costs - principal - remains fixed during the term of the loan/mortgage. In turn, monthly costs fall during the lifetime of the mortgage.
* 'interest-only': only interest is paid on the balance of the loan/mortgage.
